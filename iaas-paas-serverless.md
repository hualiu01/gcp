# IaaS & PaaS & Serverless & SaaS

__In the IaaS model, customers pay for the resources they allocate ahead of time; in the PaaS model, customers pay for the resources they actually use.__

## IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service

Delivers on-demand infrastructure resources via the cloud, such as: raw compute, storage, and network capabilities, __organized virtually into resources that are similar to physical data centers__. 

### example 

Compute Engine

## PaaS - Platform as a Service

Offers __bind code to libraries that provide access to the infrastructure application needs__. This allows more resources to be focused on application logic.

### example 

App Engine


## Serverless

__Eliminates the need for any infrastructure management__. 

### example

- Cloud Functions, which manages event-driven code as a pay-as-you-go service
- Cloud Run, which allows customers to deploy their containerized microservices based application in a fully-managed environment. 

## Saas - : Software as a Service 

While itâ€™s outside the scope of this course, you might have heard about software as a service, SaaS, and wondered what it is and how it fits into the Cloud ecosphere. 

__SaaS provides the entire application stack, delivering an entire cloud-based application that customers can access and use__. Software as a Service applications are not installed on your local computer. Instead, they run in the cloud as a service and are __consumed directly over the internet by end users__ 

Popular Google applications such as __Gmail, Docs, and Drive, that are a part of Google Workspace, are all examples of SaaS__.
